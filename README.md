# Welcome to WillyMatch!

WillyMatch is a Tinder-like web app built with React. It allows users to swipe through a "Discover" page, where they have the ability to like, dislike and favorite other users. If two users like or favorite each other, then they "match". Users who have matched are able to have live chat with each other. You can view a live demo at [willymatch.herokuapp.com](https://willymatch.herokuapp.com/discover)

For demo purposes, all users who like or favorite my account ("will") will match with me! Feel free to send me a message on WillyMatch
